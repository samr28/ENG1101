                    Trayvon Martin was an African American teenager living in Florida. He was a really good kid. When
                    he was only nine years old, he saved his father’s life by pulling him out of a fire in their
                    apartment. He also worked cutting grass, washing cars, and babysitting to earn his own money.
                    Trayvon played on his high school football team and his coach said that he was one of the best
                    players on the team. As you can see, he was a pretty typical high schooler. In 2009 he enrolled in
                    a seven week program which introduced him to aviation. This got him interested in planes and how
                    they work. This passion eventually led him to want to work on planes. As he prepared to head off to
                    college, he put his football aspirations aside in favor of a career in aviation.

                    Unfortunately, during Trayvon’s junior year of high school, he got involved with marijuana and
                    ended up getting suspended from school. One night, he went out to a 7-11 store to get some Skittles
                    and drinks. As he was returning from the store, George Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watch,
                    spotted Trayvon and called the police saying that he appeared “suspicious.” After ending the call,
                    a violent encounter took place between Zimmerman and Trayvon. It ended with Zimmerman fatally
                    shooting Trayvon.

                    When the police arrived on the scene, they attempted to revive Trayvon but were
                    unsuccessful. They took Zimmerman in to the police station for questioning. He was
                    questioned for five hours and eventually released. The police chief stated that there was
                    no evidence pointing to anything other than self defense.

                    Once the public heard of this case, they were outraged. Trayvon had done nothing wrong. He
                    was shot and killed because of his skin color. There were protests staged around the U.S.
                    calling for Zimmerman to be arrested. Trayvon’s mom created a change.org petition which
                    garnered over 2.2 million signatures. This eventually led to Zimmerman being tried and
                    convicted of murder.

                    After Zimmerman was convicted, posts on social media started showing up with the hashtag
                    “#BlackLivesMatter.” The three key organizers were Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi.
                    They were disgusted with what happened to Trayvon and wanted to work to make sure that this doesn’t
                    happen to any other young black men. In order to prevent this from happening again, they started
                    the Black Lives Matter movement. The movement aims to shed light on the injustices facing African
                    Americans.

                <p class="card-text">
                    The movement really took off in 2014 after two African American males were killed by police
                    officers. They protested around the U.S. and called for action. These protests were generally ones
                    that made people so uncomfortable that they felt that they must address the issue. One of these
                    tactics called a “die-in” is where protesters lie on the ground and simulate being dead. These
                    protests ultimately resulted in raised awareness for the issues that African Americans are facing
                    in America.

                            Weeks after the shooting of Trayvon, Tracy Martin (his mom) created a change.org petition
                            with the goal of getting Angela Corey, Florida’s 4th DIstrict State’s Attorney to
                            investigate the case. Passionate followers shared the petition on social media sites like
                            Facebook and Twitter. This resulted in the petition receiving 2,267,079 signatures in the
                            span of a few months. Eventually, Angela Corey tried Zimmerman with the charge of
                            second-degree murder. The trial started with opening statements on June 24, 2013. The jury
                            started deliberations on July 12th and on the 13th, the jury found him not guilty.

                            This left supporters with a bad feeling about the American judicial system. Ultimately this
                            discomfort only strengthened the Black Lives Matter movement.

                            On August 16th, Aretha Franklin, a singer songwriter passed away. She was also widely known
                            as the Queen of Soul. Most people are familiar with her music but aren’t aware of the civil
                            rights activism that she has participated in. She provided monetary donations to many civil
                            rights groups. She would also perform at various benefits and protests to help raise
                            awareness. Some of her songs are even based on this activism work that she’s done. For
                            example, “Respect” and “Natural Woman” have become anthems for social change.
                            <br><br>
                            When she passed away, the official Black Lives Matter facebook posted about her passing.
                            The post talks about how they appreciate her sharing her brilliance and helping so many
                            people throughout her life. This shows that the community can stay strong through difficult
                            times with things like music.

                            Another very similar movement called Blue Lives Matter was also formed around this time.
                            The organizers likely used the same naming structure in order to piggyback on the success
                            of the Black Lives Matter movement.
                            <br><br>
                            The Blue Lives Matter movement is similar to the Black Lives Matter but instead of focusing
                            on the lives of African Americans, it focuses on the lives of police officers. While this
                            may seem like the polar opposite, it isn’t. Both movements can coexist. Both movements aim
                            to make our world safer. They just focus on two different groups of people. Ideally, we
                            should make the world safer for all people. In fact, there is another movement called All
                            Lives Matter with this exact philosophy. Many argue that this movement is disrespectful and
                            reflects a view of dismissal for the racial issues that we are facing in this country. All
                            of these movements are important for furthering social equality and hopefully one day, we
                            will reach our goals and everyone will be treated equally.

                            A post by Facebook user “Darian” was made on December 5th, 2014. In this post, he shared a
                            rap music video that talked about systemic racism and police brutality. In the video, they
                            say “it’s a shame that I’m afraid to see my nephew grow up and praying that he won't be
                            next.” This is of course a reference to police brutality and the killing of innocent
                            people.
                            <br><br>
                            Later in the song, she starts listing off black men that were killed by police officers for
                            no reason. “Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Trayvon, and next month it will probably be a rest
                            in peace Dayshawn, or Kevin, or Don....” By listing off all of these names, she is trying
                            to show how out of control things are getting. She also counts on her fingers and
                            eventually runs out of fingers which again proves the point that things are getting out of
                            control.

                            By presenting this information in a catchy music video, the author is able to convey their
                            ideas and keep the audience's attention more easily. It ends up being very effective.

                            “I can’t breathe” eleven times while lying facedown on the sidewalk. Eleven times. He then
                            lost consciousness and the officers left him laying on the sidewalk. Seven minutes later,
                            an ambulance arrived. The medics didn’t perform CPR on Eric at the scene and he was
                            pronounced dead at the hospital an hour later.

                            Keith Kuder made a post on Facebook with a video of a comedian talking about the incident.
                            He basically made fun of the officers saying that they couldn’t follow basic rules. He then
                            briefly touches on systemic racism saying that the officers can check a book to see what’s
                            allowed and in this book, it says that killing black people is ok. We all know that this is
                            not true but it helped make his systemic racism point clear.
