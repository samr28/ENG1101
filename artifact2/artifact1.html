                    To understand the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, we first need to understand what ALS is.
                    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called Lou Gehrig's disease) is a non-curable disease where
                    nerve cells break down resulting in loss of muscle functions. This leads to patients losing control
                    of their muscles. The disease starts with subtle fine motor skill issues and/or muscle twitching.
                    As the disease progresses, patients lose control of more muscles including those that allow for
                    talking, walking, and breathing. At this point, they will need outside help for basic tasks such as
                    eating, getting dressed, or showering. The disease affects everyone differently so it’s impossible
                    to tell how fast one’s condition will worsen and which muscles will stop working when.

                    Unfortunately, <strong>ALS is always fatal</strong> because it will eventually make the patient
                    lose control of
                    their diaphragm making it impossible to breathe without the help of an external machine.

                            The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is an activity where the participant dumps a large bucket of
                            ice water
                            on their head. It’s usually more popular in the summer and warmer parts of the year. The
                            challenge
                            went viral during the summer of 2014. Participants would dump the water on their head and
                            then
                            typically nominate three other people to do the same. Those nominees then have 24 hours to
                            complete
                            the challenge. If they don’t then they have to make a donation to the ALS Association.

                            The challenge was first shown on television in 2014 when hosts of the Golf Channel
                            performed a live
                            on-air ice bucket challenge. Later that year, Matt Lauer did the challenge on NBC’s The
                            Today show.
                            On that same day, a golfer named Chris Kennedy did the challenge and challenged his cousin
                            Jeanette
                            Serchia. Her husband had ALS for 11 years and this challenge was the first documented case
                            connected to ALS. At this point the challenge wasn’t directly connected to ALS, those
                            challenged
                            that chose not to participate would simply donate to a charity of their choice.

                    A man named Pat Quinn (diagnosed with ALS in 2013) was friends on Facebook with Jeanette Serchia.
                    After seeing her post about the challenge, he encouraged his friends to take the challenge. Pete
                    Frates (diagnosed with ALS in 2012) then saw these posts and began posting and sharing with his
                    friends. These two are credited with starting the challenge. It soon went viral, reaching as high
                    as the president, Barack Obama.

                    The challenge was a huge success, resulting in more than 2.4 million posts on Facebook. In terms of
                    monetary donations, the ALS Association reported that they had received $41.8 million in donations
                    from 739,000 new donors.

                    With this money, the ALS Association made a huge research breakthrough. In 2016, researchers using
                    the donation money discovered that the disease was connected to a certain gene which may eventually
                    lead to new treatment possibilities. The gene, NEK1, is associated with 3% of ALS cases but is
                    present in both inherited and sporadic forms of ALS which provides a new target for treatments.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            In 2015, Mark Zuckerberg was challenged by Governor Chris Christie to do the ice bucket
                            challenge. He then nominated Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, and Reed Hastings.
                            <br><br>
                            The video starts off with Mark in what looks like his backyard. He talks about the
                            challenge and how it works. Since he was nominated early in the challenge, he spent some of
                            his time explaining how it works for those that hadn't seen it before.
                            <br><br>
                            He then dumps a large bucket of ice water on his head and doesn’t have much of a reaction
                            to it. He just says “wow, that was really cold.” Most of the other participants yell and
                            have a much stronger reaction to a huge bucket of ice cold water being dumped on their
                            head.
                            <br><br>
                            There’s a running joke that says that Mark is a robot. We all know that this isn’t true but
                            some of his actions (like his reaction to the ice water) make it seem as if it were true.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            On August 16th, Elon Musk participated in the ice bucket challenge. As the founder of
                            multiple hugely successful technology startups, he is a very creative person. So for his
                            challenge, he decided to do something extraordinary. He built a contraption with five
                            separate buckets hung on a tree. Five buckets, one for each of his children. The kids all
                            pulled their strings at the same time and the buckets all dumped on Elon.
                            <br><br>
                            His challenge video was unique because it was shot from a far distance and you couldn’t
                            really hear what (if anything) he was saying. He didn’t nominate anyone in the video and
                            instead opted to write it in the description. In addition, the nominations were made by
                            Elon’s sons instead of him. Elon decided to nominate Minecraft creator Markus Peterson,
                            Johnny Depp, and Tonk Hawk. His unlisted video received half a million views and was posted
                            directly to the SpaceX Youtube channel.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            On August 15th, 2015, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, joined in and participated in
                            the ice bucket challenge. He was challenged by Mark Zuckerberg and chose to nominate Elon
                            Musk, Ryan Seacrest, and Chris Anderson.
                            <br><br>
                            The video starts off with Bill watching Mark do the ice bucket challenge on a new Microsoft
                            Surface device. He then says “I’m glad to give to ALS, it’s a great cause but I want to do
                            it better than it’s been done.” He then shows designs for a contraption that will dump the
                            ice bucket on his head when he pulls a rope.
                            <br><br>
                            His video was particularly interesting because instead of simply pouring a bucket of ice
                            water over his head, he built this machine that did it for him. This shows his internal
                            creativity and extreme excitement for engineering and design. This personal touch made his
                            video stand out and was part of the reason that this video received over 26 million views
                            on Youtube.

                            Markus is a Swedish programmer and video game designer. He is best known for starting the

                            In his video, Markus attached a camera to his ice bucket. By doing this, his video gained a
                            unique perspective. It looks like he had a lot of fun recording the video. He chose to
                            nominate some other video game designers like Cliff Bleszinski, Bobby Kotick, and Phil
                            Spencer.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Phil Spencer is the current vice-president of gaming at Microsoft. He is also the head of
                            the Xbox brand, leading many different teams responsible for gaming at Microsoft. In his
                            ice bucket challenge, Phil is wearing an Aperture Laboratories shirt which is from a
                            popular video game called Portal. This shows his inner video game loving self and makes him
                            seem very relatable and down to earth.
                            <br><br>
                            Two Microsoft employees then pour a huge bucket of ice water onto his head. The video goes
                            into slow motion to add dramatic effect. This works really well and helps the viewer feel
                            how cold the water actually is. We can see ice flying out in slow motion and this really
                            adds a unique spin to the typical ice bucket challenge video. Phil then says that he
                            nominates Shuhei Yoshida from Sony, Reggie Fils-Aime from Nintendo and Gabe Newell from
                            Valve to participate in the challenge.
