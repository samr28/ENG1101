                    time because of his use of the “casting couch” technique. This is where a producer will exchange
                    casting roles for sexual favors. Unfortunately, this is somewhat common in the industry. Of course
                    this is completely immoral and most will agree that it shouldn’t be allowed. One of the women
                    affected by this said “if Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party at the four seasons,
                    don’t go.”

                            admitted to these acts. When the police records and case information went public, many
                            media sites
                            published negative stories about Ambra, calling her an opportunist. Some publications even
                            agreed
                            to help suppress the allegations. The district attorney ultimately decided not to file
                            charges,
                            citing that they didn’t have enough evidence.

                    exchange for
                    sex, but so did and still does everyone.” So there was clearly enough evidence yet the
                    attorney
                    dropped the case. This shows that our current system is not set up to properly handle

                            In order to combat this and attempt to fix our broken system, a movement called “Me Too”
                            was
                            founded. This movement was originally started by a social activist named Tarana Burke. She

                            using “#MeToo” on Myspace as part of a campaign to promote female empowerment among women
                            of color.
                            That first movement wasn’t widely successful but was revived in 2017 by actress Alyssa
                            Milano. She

                            Facebook using the hashtag. Facebook reported that 45% of U.S. users had at least one

                    The campaign resulted in a congressional bill. This bill proposed member and employee training on
                    the Congress Act. The bill was bipartisan, hoping to gain support from both sides of the aisle.
                    Specifically, the bill aimed to change how the legislative branch treats sexual harassment
                    complaints. The old system was slow and very wasteful of federal resources. In fact, it was
                    reported that in the past ten years, $15 million dollars had been spent settling these complaints.
                    This bill ensures that claims will be settled in 180 days or less and the funding would come from
                    the involved Senators and Representatives. The settlements will also become public, instead of
                    remaining a secret. In addition, these rights would now be given to interns, fellows, and other
                    unpaid interns.

                            Trump tried to claim that she wasn’t remembering things properly. He did an impersonation

                            It seems that the people in the comments are getting caught up in who started the movement
                            and who should really get the credit for it. Instead of focusing on this, they should be
                            looking at what the movement can accomplish.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            A twitter user named PMbeers posted on twitter just a few days ago that “The only time
                            white men care about sexual harassment... is when they think a man of color did it.” The
                            post shows how the Me Too movement transcends through so many different social issues like
                            race. It also talks about the patriarchy implying that white men are the ones making
                            decisions that affect all of us. This is not true but the post is trying to paint a picture
                            much worse than it actually is. While the intention of the post is clear, it doesn’t take
                            into account many other factors which are at play like socioeconomic status.
                            <br><br>
                            In the comments, there is a Twitter user who tried to nullify the point by claiming that
                            they are a white male concerned with rape of anyone, of any sex or color. So he is
                            providing anecdotal evidence of the case being false. Of course there were replies to this
                            comment and one of which was “Awesome, Go out and share your views with other men.”

                        <p class="card-text">
                            This post talks about sexual assault survivors in India and how that environment makes it
                            very difficult to deal with sexual assault. They don’t have the same resources available to
                            them as we do here in America. As the movement is becoming more widespread people are
                            struggling to define what constitutes Gatessexual harassment.
                            <br><br>
                            In these different cultures, people are more afraid to speak out because it could be
                            considered shameful and they won’t get the support that they need. This is particularly
                            relevant in today’s political environment where we are getting close to electing people who
                            may have committed these things.
                            <br><br>
                            In the United States, we think that sexual assault is something that is isolated here but
                            this post helps us realize that this is a global issue. In fact, it’s more of an issue in
                            other places than it is here in the States because of cultural differences and stigmas.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            In this post, a Twitter user made a post that mocked the Me Too movement. The image that
                            they posted was a spin off of what the kids like to call “memes.” In this meme, a lady is
                            crying and it has a caption saying that her doctor molested her when she was born. Of
                            course this is not actually molestation. The meme is trying to say that sexual assault is
                            not real and that those that have experienced it are making a deal out of nothing. This is
                            not true and really hurting the Me Too movement.
                            <br><br>
                            The post is really trying to make light of a very serious issue. This may just be a way of
                            coping but that seems somewhat unlikely.
