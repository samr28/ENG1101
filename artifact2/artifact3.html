                    In October of 2017, film producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="ttt"><i>sexual
                            abuse</i></span>. Dozens of women
                    accused him of rape, sexual assault, and sexual abuse. He was able to get away with this for some
                    time because of his use of the “casting couch” technique. This is where a producer will exchange
                    casting roles for sexual favors. Unfortunately, this is somewhat common in the industry. Of course
                    this is completely immoral and most will agree that it shouldn’t be allowed. One of the women
                    affected by this said “if Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party at the four seasons,
                    don’t go.”

                    When the media tried to get first hand accounts of those affected, none of the women would speak on
                    record. The editors decided that they couldn’t mention the assault allegations without the victim's
                    input.

                    In 2015, Weinstein was taken in by the police for questioning after Ambra Gutierrez, an Italian
                    model, accused him of sexual assault. Ambra worked with police to get an audio where Weinstein
                    admitted to these acts. When the police records and case information went public, many media sites
                    published negative stories about Ambra, calling her an opportunist. Some publications even agreed
                    to help suppress the allegations. The district attorney ultimately decided not to file charges,
                    citing that they didn’t have enough evidence.

                    Weinstein even admitted in an interview “yes, I did offer them [girls] acting jobs in exchange for
                    sex, but so did and still does everyone.” So there was clearly enough evidence yet the attorney
                    dropped the case. This shows that our current system is not set up to properly handle sexual
                    misconduct cases.

                    In order to combat this and attempt to fix our broken system, a movement called “Me Too” was
                    founded. This movement was originally started by a social activist named Tarana Burke. She started
                    using “#MeToo” on Myspace as part of a campaign to promote female empowerment among women of color.
                    That first movement wasn’t widely successful but was revived in 2017 by actress Alyssa Milano. She
                    used the hashtag to draw attention to sexual assault and harassment.

                    This time, the campaign was hugely successful. Within 24 hours, there had been 12 million posts on
                    Facebook using the hashtag. Facebook reported that 45% of U.S. users had at least one friend that
                    used the hashtag in a post.

                    The campaign resulted in a congressional bill. This bill proposed member and employee training on
                    the Congress Act. The bill was bipartisan, hoping to gain support from both sides of the aisle.
                    Specifically, the bill aimed to change how the legislative branch treats sexual harassment
                    complaints. The old system was slow and very wasteful of federal resources. In fact, it was
                    reported that in the past ten years, $15 million dollars had been spent settling these complaints.
                    This bill ensures that claims will be settled in 180 days or less and the funding would come from
                    the involved Senators and Representatives. The settlements will also become public, instead of
                    remaining a secret. In addition, these rights would now be given to interns, fellows, and other
                    unpaid interns.

                            Weeks after the shooting of Trayvon, Tracy Martin (his mom) created a change.org petition
                            with the goal of getting Angela Corey, Florida’s 4th DIstrict State’s Attorney to
                            investigate the case. Passionate followers shared the petition on social media sites like
                            Facebook and Twitter. This resulted in the petition receiving 2,267,079 signatures in the
                            span of a few months. Eventually, Angela Corey tried Zimmerman with the charge of
                            second-degree murder. The trial started with opening statements on June 24, 2013. The jury
                            started deliberations on July 12th and on the 13th, the jury found him not guilty.

                            This left supporters with a bad feeling about the American judicial system. Ultimately this
                            discomfort only strengthened the Black Lives Matter movement.

                            Second degree murder: Intentional murder without planning or a killing caused by the
                            offender’s lack of concern for human life.

                            On August 16th, Aretha Franklin, a singer songwriter passed away. She was also widely known
                            as the Queen of Soul. Most people are familiar with her music but aren’t aware of the civil
                            rights activism that she has participated in. She provided monetary donations to many civil
                            rights groups. She would also perform at various benefits and protests to help raise
                            awareness. Some of her songs are even based on this activism work that she’s done. For
                            example, “Respect” and “Natural Woman” have become anthems for social change.

                            When she passed away, the official Black Lives Matter facebook posted about her passing.
                            The post talks about how they appreciate her sharing her brilliance and helping so many
                            people throughout her life. This shows that the community can stay strong through difficult
                            times with things like music.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            On August 15th, 2015, Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, joined in and participated in
                            the ice bucket challenge. He was challenged by Mark Zuckerberg and chose to nominate Elon
                            Musk, Ryan Seacrest, and Chris Anderson.

                            The video starts off with Bill watching Mark do the ice bucket challenge on a new Microsoft
                            Surface device. He then says “I’m glad to give to ALS, it’s a great cause but I want to do
                            it better than it’s been done.” He then shows designs for a contraption that will dump the
                            ice bucket on his head when he pulls a rope.

                            His video was particularly interesting because instead of simply pouring a bucket of ice
                            water over his head, he built this machine that did it for him. This shows his internal
                            creativity and extreme excitement for engineering and design. This personal touch made his
                            video stand out and was part of the reason that this video received over 26 million views
                            on Youtube.

                            Minecraft.

                            In his video, Markus attached a camera to his ice bucket. By doing this, his video gained a
                            unique perspective. It looks like he had a lot of fun recording the video. He chose to
                            nominate some other video game designers like Cliff Bleszinski, Bobby Kotick, and Phil

                            the Xbox brand, leading many different teams responsible for gaming at Microsoft. In his
                            ice bucket challenge, Phil is wearing an Aperture Laboratories shirt which is from a
                            popular video game called Portal. This shows his inner video game loving self and makes him
                            seem very relatable and down to earth.

                            Two Microsoft employees then pour a huge bucket of ice water onto his head. The video goes
                            into slow motion to add dramatic effect. This works really well and helps the viewer feel
                            how cold the water actually is. We can see ice flying out in slow motion and this really
                            adds a unique spin to the typical ice bucket challenge video. Phil then says that he
                            nominates Shuhei Yoshida from Sony, Reggie Fils-Aime from Nintendo and Gabe Newell from
                            Valve to participate in the challenge.
